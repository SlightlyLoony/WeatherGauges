Getting Connected

The process of getting connected is controlled by two (related) state machines: one for the network connection and one for the display.


Network connection state machine

The state of the network connection state machine persists across Raspberry Pi boots.  The text contents of the file /home/weathergauges/nc.state
contains the state as a simple text string.

State       Notes                                                                   Transition

INIT        This is the initial state of the network connection, and if the state   To HOTSPOT (after reboot) when country and band have been selected
            file is missing or invalid, this state is assumed.  Being in this       and hotspot mode is enabled.
            state means that we don't know how to connect to the internet, and
            that we don't know if the hotspot mode is enabled.

HOTSPOT     The network is configured as a hotspot, and we're waiting for the user  To CONNECT (after reboot) when the network configuration has been
            to connect via WiFi and configure the network connection.               made and applied.

CONNECT     The network configuration has been applied, but not tested.             To CONNECTED if an Internet connectivity test succeeds.
                                                                                    Otherwise, to INIT or HOTSPOT (after reboot) depending on user
                                                                                    selection.

CONNECTED   The network configuration has been applied and tested.  This is the     To INIT or HOTSPOT (after reboot) depending on user selection.
            "normal" network connection mode for WeatherGauges.                     A user may initiate this transition manually, or he may be
                                                                                    presented with a choice after WeatherGauges detects an Internet
                                                                                    connectivity problem.


Display state machine

The state of the display state machine persists across Raspberry Pi boots.  The text contents of the file /home/weathergauges/display.state contains
the state as a simple text string.

State       Notes                                                                   Transition

CB          This is the initial state of the display, and if the state file is      To NC when the network connection state transitions to HOTSPOT.
            missing or invalid, this state is assumed.  In this state, the
            display gives the user the ability to choose the country and band
            that WiFi should be configured for.  The country selection will
            also affect the defaults for other selections.

NC          Displays an information screen telling the user how to connect to       To PROVIDER when the network connection state transitions to
            the hotspot to get the network configuration page.                      CONNECTED.

PROVIDER    Displays an information screen telling the user how to connect to       To CF once a provider has been provisioned and tested.  Back
            the connected WeatherGauges to set/modify the weather data              to PROVIDER (with error message) if a provider is provisioned but
            providers.                                                              a test fails.  Note that multiple providers may be provisioned,
                                                                                    and if so then ALL provisioned providers must test successfully.

CF          Displays an information screen telling the user how to connect to       To CURRENT when a valid configuration has been entered.  Back to
            the connected WeatherGauges to modify the device's configuration.       CF (with error message) if an invalid configuration has been
                                                                                    entered.

WHAT        Displays a page that lets the user choose amongst various actions:      If the user chooses VIEW, to CURRENT.  If the user chooses BACK,
            VIEW - view current weather information                                 erase configuration file, set network connection state to INIT,
            BACK - back to factory defaults                                         and display state to CB, then reboot.  If the user chooses CONN,
            CONN - reconfigure network connection                                   set network connection state to INIT, and display state to CB,
            PROV - reconfigure weather data providers                               then reboot.  If the user chooses PROV, set the display state to
            CONF - reconfigure WeatherGauges configuration                          PROVIDER.  If the user chooses CONF, set the display state to CF.

CURRENT     Displays the current weather information screen.                        To WHAT if the user presses both buttons.  To FORECAST (with 1
                                                                                    day) if the user presses only the right button.  To HISTORY (with
                                                                                    1 day) if the user presses only the left button.

FORECAST    Displays the forecast information screen for a day in the future.       To CURRENT if the user presses both buttons.  If the user presses
                                                                                    only the right button, and if there is another day of forecast
                                                                                    data available, then advances to the next day of forecast.
                                                                                    Otherwise does nothing.  If the user presses only the left button,
                                                                                    and if an earlier day of forecast information is available, then
                                                                                    goes back to that day of forecast.  Otherwise to CURRENT.

HISTORY     Displays historical weather information for a day in the past.          To CURRENT if the user presses both buttons.  If the user presses
                                                                                    only the left button, and if there is another day of history data
                                                                                    available, then goes to that day of historical data.  Otherwise
                                                                                    does nothing.  If the user presses only the right button, and if
                                                                                    there is a more recent day of historical data available, then goes
                                                                                    to that day of historical data.  Otherwise to CURRENT.
