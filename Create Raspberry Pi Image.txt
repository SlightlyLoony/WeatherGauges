Create Raspberry Pi Image

This documents details the process for creating a Raspberry Pi operating system image (on an SD RAM card) ready for insertion in a fresh Raspberry Pi:

1.  Mount a 32GB SD RAM card in the development system (Mac).

2.  Use the Raspberry Pi Imager application (in Applications) to download and install the latest operating system image.  Choose the minimal
    configuration that includes the desktop, and the SD RAM card you mounted.  This will create an SD RAM card image with an OS bootable on the
    Raspberry Pi.

3.  The Raspberry Pi Imager finishes by unmounting the SD RAM card.  Physically remove the SD RAM card and reinsert it to force it to mount.

4.  That SD RAM card will have a partition named "boot".  In the root of that partition, copy the file "issue.txt" (or any other small file) to a
    new file named "ssh", with no extension.  The contents of this file are irrelevant.  This triggers the Raspberry Pi OS to enable SSH on boot.

5.  Eject the SD RAM card.

6.  Log into the development system as its normal user (<user>).

7.  Mount the SD RAM card on any development Linux system.  First identify the device:

            sudo fdisk -l   # look for this:
                            #-------------------
                            # Disk /dev/sde: 29.8 GiB, 32010928128 bytes, 62521344 sectors
                            # Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
                            # Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
                            # I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
                            # Disklabel type: dos
                            # Disk identifier: 0x9fb1957f
                            #
                            # Device     Boot  Start     End Sectors  Size Id Type
                            # /dev/sde1         8192  532479  524288  256M  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)
                            # /dev/sde2       532480 7479295 6946816  3.3G 83 Linux
                            #-------------------
                            # the /dev/sde2 is my device!

        Then mount the device at /media:

            sudo mount /dev/sde2 /media    # root directory of SD card appears in /media

8.  Create the /home/pi/.ssh directory, with mode 700 and owner pi.  First find the UID/GID for pi:

            ls -lan /media/home/pi  # lists mode, number of links, UID, GID, size

        Then

            sudo mkdir /media/home/pi/.ssh             # creates the directory but with root as the owner and group...
            sudo chown 1000:1000 /media/home/pi/.ssh   # changes the UID and GID (1000:1000 in this case)...
            sudo chmod 700 /media/home/pi/.ssh         # changes the mode to 700

9.  Copy Tom's public key (/home/tom/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to the just-created .ssh directory as the new authorized_keys file AND as the new id_rsa.pub
    file, with the correct owner (pi UID/GID) and mode (644).

            sudo cp /home/tom/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /media/home/pi/.ssh                   # copy the existing public key file...
            sudo cp /home/tom/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /media/home/pi/.ssh/authorized_keys   # and again...
            sudo chown 1000:1000 /media/home/pi/.ssh/authorized_keys                # change owners...
            sudo chown 1000:1000 /media/home/pi/.ssh/id_rsa.pub                     # and again...

10. Create the file /ImageID with the contents "Weather Gauges 1" on a single line.  The file should have mode 644.  Note that the trailing "1" is
    intended as a version number.  If the image changes in some way in the future (say, a new OS version) that would affect the deployment script,
    then the version number can let the script make allowances.

            sudo nano /media/ImageID

11. Unmount the now-configured SD RAM card - you're done!

            sudo umount /media

12. Clone the card to create the master image, using Disk Utility.  Change the name of the resulting file to <something>.iso.  See:

13. Clone the image to any number of SD cards using the balenaEtcher app.
