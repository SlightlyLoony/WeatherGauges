Create Raspberry Pi Image

This documents details the process for creating a Raspberry Pi operating system image (on an SD RAM card) ready for insertion in a fresh Raspberry Pi:

1.  Mount a 32GB SD RAM card in the development system (Mac).

2.  Use the Raspberry Pi Imager application (in Applications) to download and install the latest operating system image.  Choose the minimal
    configuration that includes the desktop, and the SD RAM card you mounted.  This will create an SD RAM card image with an OS bootable on the
    Raspberry Pi.

3.  The Raspberry Pi Imager finishes by unmounting the SD RAM card.  Physically remove the SD RAM card and reinsert it to force it to mount.

4.  That SD RAM card will have a partition named "boot".  In the root of that partition, copy the file "issue.txt" (or any other small file) to a
    new file named "ssh", with no extension.  The contents of this file are irrelevant.  This triggers the Raspberry Pi OS to enable SSH on boot.

5.  Eject the SD RAM card.

6.  Mount the SD RAM card on any development Linux system.

7.  Log into the development system as the user "pi".

8.  Create the /home/pi/.ssh directory, with mode 700:
        cd /<mount>/home/pi   # where <mount> is the mounted volume's path
        mkdir -m 700 .ssh
        ls -al                # to verify

9.  Copy Tom's public key (/Users/tom/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to the just-created .ssh directory as the new authorized_keys file.  If the development system
    has the public key, copy from /home/pi/.ssh/authorized_keys to /<mount>/home/pi/.ssh - otherwise, use scp to get it from Tom's development system.
    Use ls -al to verify that the authorized_keys file has mode 644.

10. Unmount the now-configured SD RAM card - you're done.
